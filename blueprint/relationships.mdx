description: Referencing data in other Sheets
icon: 'link'
---
<Warning>
This is not comparable to a foreign key. There should be no specification of which column to reference as it is multi-variate. A user may establish a relationship in mapping with a soft reference like a company name. Once stored in our system, we will reference by our internal IDs, and on egress we provide the known system_id if available.
</Warning>


The relationship defines a reference to another Sheet. Links should be established automatically by the mapping engine (the logic that creates a mapping plan automatically when a user maps their data into a workbook) or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar columns between datasets.

## Configuration Options
- **ref** - Full path reference to another Sheet/table configuration. Must be in the same Workbook
- **relationship** - The type of relationship this defines. Currently, only `has-one` is supported


## Usage
This example defines two fields with a relationship which references the respective email addresses of the father / mother which is found in another Sheet

```json workbooks.create
// in the context of create Workbook API call
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "father",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "mother",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Here's an example of how to set up lookup functionality with reference fields:
```
/**
Performs a vlookup-like operation on a record by retrieving a value from a linked record
and setting it to a target field on the original record. The linked record is specified
by a reference field on the original record, and the lookup value is specified by a
lookup field on the linked record. If a lookup value is found, it is set to the target
field on the original record and an info message is added to the record indicating
the source of the value.
@param {Object} record - The record to perform the vlookup on.
@param {string} referenceFieldKey - The name of the reference field on the original record
that links to the linked record.
@param {string} lookupFieldKey - The name of the field on the linked record that contains
the value to be looked up.
@param {string} targetFieldKey - The name of the field on the original record that the
lookup value should be set to.
*/
export const vlookup = (
  record,
  referenceFieldKey,
  lookupFieldKey,
  targetFieldKey
) => {
  console.log('Initial Record: ' + JSON.stringify(record));
  const links = record.getLinks(referenceFieldKey);
  console.log('Linked Record: ' + JSON.stringify(links));
  const lookupValue = links?.[0]?.[lookupFieldKey];
  console.log(
    'Reference Fields Key: ' +
      referenceFieldKey +
      ' : ' +
      'LookUpValue: ' +
      lookupValue
  );

  if (isNotNil(lookupValue)) {
    record.set(targetFieldKey, lookupValue);
    record.addInfo(
      targetFieldKey,
      `${targetFieldKey} set based on ${referenceFieldKey}.`
    );
  }
};
```
