An Action is a code-based operation that runs where that Action is mounted. Actions run when a user clicks the corresponding user prompt in Flatfile. Actions can be mounted on a Sheet, a Workbook, a Space, or a file.

## The Anatomy of an Action

All Actions contain the the information needed to let a user run the Action. This includes:
- `operation` - A unique identifier for the Action that is used by the listener to determine what work to do as part of the resulting Job
- `label` - The text that will be displayed to the user in the UI as a button or menu item

Optionally, an Action can also contain extra details about how it appears in the UI. These include:
- `primary` - Whether the Action is a primary Action for the resource. Depending on the resource, primary Actions are displayed in the UI in a more prominent way.
- `confirm` - When set to `true`, a modal is shown to confirm the Action
- `description` -  The text that will be displayed to the user when a confirmation modal is used. Phrase this as a question.      
- `requireSelection`- Setting this to `true` will disable a Sheet Action when no records in the Sheet are selected.
- `mode` - Can be `foreground` or `background`. Foreground actions will prevent interacting with the resource until complete. The default value is `background`.

## Example

An Action with all of the above properties would look like this:

```js
{
  operation: 'my-action',
  label: 'My Action',
  primary: true,
  confirm: true,
  description: 'Are you sure you want to run this action?',
  requireSelection: true,
  mode: 'foreground'
}
```
