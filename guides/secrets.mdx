With Secrets, you can use credentials in listeners, without explicitly knowing their values upfront. Credentials are set in the user interface.

## Overview

Secrets in Flatfile, defined as Name/Value pairs, are securely stored within an Environment and can be fine-tuned within a Space. These secrets can be accessed via API endpoints and are available in the event object during listener context. 

Emphasizing security, Flatfile employs stringent encryption measures during transit and at rest in our datastore, and adds an extra layer of encryption/decryption using a unique set of keys on demand. A potential intruder would need not only access to the datastore, but also these extra keys to compromise these values.

## Managing Secrets

You can create secrets at either the environment or space level. When creating a secret for an environment, navigate to the Developer section of the sidebar and access Developer settings. In the Environment Secrets section, click the plus sign to add a secret. Each secret requires a Name and Secret Value. Once entered, you can save the secret by checking the corresponding box. To edit or remove a secret, click the pencil and paper icon or the trashcan icon, respectively.

Creating secrets at the space level can only be done by users with the Administrator role. In the space sidebar, click on the "Secrets" link. Here, you can view the environment secrets with the Secret Value masked for security purposes. In the Space Secrets section, click the plus sign to add a secret. Like before, provide a Name and Secret Value, and save the secret by checking the box. Editing or removing a secret can be done using the pencil and paper icon or the trashcan icon.

## Usage

### Sensitive Credentials 

The principal utility of Secrets lies in securely storing sensitive credentials/tokens within an Environment for connecting a listener to a third-party API. For instance, you might store a secret named `SLACK_TOKEN` with a value of `xoxb-e5b7206ccac446048a8a52b703dbb4b9`, allowing you to communicate with a Slack bot each time a custom action is triggered.

#### Example Listener

In this example, we use an event.fetch call to pull a sensitive Slack token for use within a listener context. We then post a message to Slack.

```jsx
listener.on('**', async (event) => {
    const tok = await event.secrets('SLACK_TOKEN')
    slack = new Slack(tok);
    slack.api('chat.postMessage', {
        text:'Flatfile event received!',
        channel:'#integration-flatfile'
     }, function(err, response){
       console.log(response || err);
    });
})
```

### Metadata 
Another application is to store metadata in an Environment or Space for associating or correlating imported data with an external datastore. Instead of adding identical fields to Sheets, you could store a Secret named 'ProjectID' in your 'production' Environment within a given Space, assigning it a value that matches the ID in another system. During an event, you can fetch the ProjectID once and use it for data correlation with external entities.
